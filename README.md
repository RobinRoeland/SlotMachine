## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### Services
The application uses a service-oriented architecture with the following core services:

- **ItemsService** - Manages slot items with reactive updates
- **ValidationService** - Centralizes validation logic
- **FileService** - Handles file import/export operations
- **PrizeService** - Manages prizes and prize calculations
- **OddsService** - Manages item odds and probabilities
- **SettingsService** - Application settings management
- **StorageService** - LocalStorage wrapper with observables

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
